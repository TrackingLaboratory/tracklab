        Both steps perform a linear assignment (Hungarian algorithm) based on a cost matrix between tracks and detections.
        # REID STEP WITH KF GATING
        1. To compute the first cost matrix, we compare the appearance/reid features of the CONFIRMED tracks
        (i.e. tracks older than 'n_init') w.r.t. all the detections.
        Reid features for the tracks are computed by a moving average of the reid features of their underlying detections.
        The reid cost matrix is first computed and then 'gated' by the KF gating distance.
        The first cost matrix is 0.995 of the ReID distance + 0.005 of the KF gating distance. Entries of the cost
        matrix where the KF gating distance is above the threshold are set to INFTY_COST and ignored by the linear assignment.
        Finally, after the linear assignment is performed, tracks and detections that were matched but whose cost in
        the cost matrix was above the threshold 'max_dist' are canceled and considered as not matched.

        including UNCONFIRMED tracks (that were ignored in previous step), but excluding tracks that were not updated in the previous step.
        Tracks that were not updated in the previous step can therefore only be matched using the appearance features.
        To compare these unmatched tracks and detections and compute the second cost matrix, the IOU/OKS distance is used.
        The IOU is computed between the detection's bounding box and the kalman filter predicted bounding box of the track.
        Finally, after the linear assignment is performed, tracks and detections that were matched but whose cost in
        the cost matrix was above the threshold 'max_iou_distance' are canceled and considered as not matched.
